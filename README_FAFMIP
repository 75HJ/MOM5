	MOM Code for FAFMIP Experiments

Version of 01/October/2017

MOM code for running FAFHEAT experiments as in Gregory et al. (2016).
The code, when enabled, uses Method B for the heat flux perturbation 
and introduces two new tracers: redistributed_heat and added_heat.
When running FAFHEAT, both tracers need to be initialized: 
added_heat is initialized as zero, redistributed_heat with the same 
initial conditions as the temperature tracer.

Code changes include:
- /ocean_core/ocean_bbc.F90
- /ocean_core/ocean_sbc.F90
- /ocean_core/ocean_types.F90
- /ocean_core/ocean_model.F90
- /ocean_tracers/ocean_frazil.F90
- /ocean_tracers/ocean_tpm.F90
- /ocean_tracers/ocean_tempsalt.F90
- /ocean_tracers/ocean_tracer.F90
- /ocean_param/sources/ocean_shortwave.F90

The following also have to be modified with the new tracers and appropriate flags:
- field_table
- input.nml
